# A sample Guardfile
# More info at https://github.com/guard/guard#readme

## Uncomment and set this to only include directories you want to watch
# directories %w(app lib config test spec features)

## Uncomment to clear the screen before every task
# clearing :on

## Guard internally checks for changes in the Guardfile and exits.
## If you want Guard to automatically start up again, run guard in a
## shell loop, e.g.:
##
##  $ while bundle exec guard; do echo "Restarting Guard..."; done
##
## Note: if you are using the `directories` clause above and you are not
## watching the project directory ('.'), then you will want to move
## the Guardfile to a watched dir and symlink it back, e.g.
#
#  $ mkdir config
#  $ mv Guardfile config/
#  $ ln -s config/Guardfile .
#
# and, you'll have to watch "config/Guardfile" instead of "Guardfile"
